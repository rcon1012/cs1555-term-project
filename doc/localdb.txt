If you want to use sqlplus and java jdbc locally, you can by downloading:

Oracle Database Express Edition 11g Release 2 for Windows x64
from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html

and

ojdbc7.jar
from
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html

For your connection url, use:
"jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe"

and for your username, use:
"SYSTEM"

the password is set during installation. I used "password".
If xe doesn't work for you, use the command:

"select instance_name from v$instance;"
If SYSTEM doesn't work for you, try "sys" or "SYSADMIN"
